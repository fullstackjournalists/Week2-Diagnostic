# Week 2 Diagnostic: Git and Github

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository. Answer the questions in your own words. We are
not looking for copy-paste answers from the Internet, although you are allowed
to use Google, your notes, and your repositories during the diagnostic.

When you are done, make a pull request on the main repo. You must make your
pull request before the time announced by the instructor or you will not be graded.

If you are doing this as a self-guided/remote assignment, timing requirements do not apply. If you would like to simulate what we do in class, set a timer for 15 minutes and do the following:

* Fork and clone this repository
* Open week2-diagnostic.md in your text editor
* Answer the questions to the best of your ability in your own words. Don't copy-paste.
* Add, commit, and push your changes to your own copy of this repository on Github.
* Make a pull request to the master repository.

If you use code in your answers, use [codefencing](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/).

11. You have merged your `fancy-new-feature` branch into your `master` branch and made a pull request, but the team decides they don't want that feature. How do you roll back the code in your `master` branch to the point before you merged `fancy-new-feature`?
